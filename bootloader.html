Drag this link into your bookmarks bar, then go to a New York Times crossword, and click the bookmark. It will show what everyone else has on their crossword so far. The letters just act like ghosts- you can't overwrite other people's letters, and they can't overwrite yours. They also don't count towards solving the puzzle. You have to ink over them.

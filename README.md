# Collaborative Crossword

This is a bookmarklet which allows you to sync your progress on a [New York Times crossword puzzle](https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords) with friends. Click the link below and drag the link at that page into your bookmarks bar. Then go to a puzzle (daily or mini, not acrostic or other special variants) and click the bookmarklet. You will see the progress of all other participants as grey shadows. You can type over them, and other players will see your contributions. The other players letters don't count towards solving the puzzle, so make sure to ink over it yourself if you agree.
